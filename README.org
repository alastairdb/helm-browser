* Introduction

*helm-browser* is an Emacs package that implement a helm interface. *helm-browser* can be used to quickly find and switch between multiple browser windows and tabs.

Presently, *helm-browser* can be used to:
- find and switch to selected browser windows/tabs
- select and close one or multiple tabs
- copy a tab's URL (to yank into a document) 

This package is based on [[https://github.com/bdc34/helm-taskswitch][helm-taskswitch]]  (also available via MELPA). Which is great except it does not deal with tabs. I have hundreds of tabs open across half a dozen browser windows and needed some way to locate tabs.
** Dependencies
- [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]]
- [[https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/wmctrl/][wmctrl]]
- [[https://github.com/balta2ar/brotab][brotab]]

This package will only work on Linux and only these web browsers: Firefox, Chromium, Chrome, Brave Browser. It has been most extensively tested with Firefox. 
* Installation
** Install Dependencies
- Make sure *helm* is installed, configured and working (please see helm documentation for installation & configuration). This is an excellent guide: [[https://tuhdo.github.io/helm-intro.html][A Package in a league of its own: *Helm*]].
- Install *wmctrl* (use your distribution's package manager)
- Install *brotab* 
    1. Install/upgrade *pipx*: =pip install --user -U pipx=
    2. Install *brotab*: =pipx install brotab=
         - By default, *brotab* will be installed in: ~/.local/bin/.
         - Optionally, you can add ~/.local/bin/ to the PATH.
    3. Confirm that *brotab* is installed and working: =bt= or if not in PATH: =~/.local/bin/bt=
    4. Install =brotab= native app manifests: =bt install=
    5. Install one or more browser extensions:
         - Firefox: [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/brotab/]]
         - Chrome/Chromium/Brave: [[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/brotab/mhpeahbikehnfkfnmopaigggliclhmnc/]]
    6. Restart browser(s)
** Emacs Installation and Configuration
Put *helm-browser.el* in your *load-path* and put this in your *init* file:
#+begin_src elisp :tangle no
(require 'helm-browser)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x b") 'helm-browser) ;Set key binding (recommended)
(setq  helm-browser-focus-tab-wait-time 2.5) ;Default. Increase this delay if you have a slower system or low memory.
#+end_src
* Future Features (Maybe!)
- Publish in MELPA
- Bookmark one or multiple selected tabs
- Search for text in one or multiple selected tabs
- I _may_ look into making this work on Windows & Mac
* Feedback
This is my first Emacs Lisp program (started learning Lisp just a few months ago), so I am sure there are things that may be considered sloppy Lisp :-) Please feel free to file bug reports, suggestions and feature requests.
